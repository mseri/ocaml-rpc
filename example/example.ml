(* Example RPC *)

(* The following is an example of how to use the ocaml-rpc library to define an
   interface, then use that interface to implement a client and server.

   The library is designed to be used with a ppx helper, but there is no
   requirement to use it, and for the sake of clearly describing the library
   this example does not use the ppx.
*)

open Idl

(* Interfaces are described as a collection of methods which take some typed
   arguments and return a typed result, or possiby an error. These are declared
   as a functor which takes as an argument a module that conforms to the 'RPC'
   signature,defined in idl.ml.

   For example, the following functor declares 2 methods, `api1` and `api2`.
   The parameters are described first and can be fairly minimal (see `b1` for
   example)
*)

module MyAPI(R : RPC) = struct
  open R

  let description = Interface.{
      name = "MyAPI";
      namespace = Some "MYAPI";
      description =
        ["This is an example showing how to use the IDL part of the ocaml-rpc ";
         "library. What goes here is a description of the interface we're ";
         "currently describing."];
      version=(1,0,0);
    }
  let implementation = implement description

  (* We can define some named parameters here. These can be used in different
     method declarations *)
  let i1 = Param.mk ~name:"i1" ~description:["Parameter i1"] Rpc.Types.int
  let s1 = Param.mk ~name:"s1" ~description:["Parameter s1"] Rpc.Types.string

  (* Parameters don't _have_ to have names and descriptions, in which case they
     will inherit from the name and description of the type. *)
  let b1 = Param.mk Rpc.Types.bool

  (* For the following methods, we use the default error type for any errors
     the methods may throw *)
  let e1 = Idl.DefaultError.err

  (* `declare` is defined in the RPC module passed in, and can do several
     different things. It is only the following two lines that actually do
     anything in this module - the declarations of parameters above are useful
     only in allowing the two declarations here to be succinct. *)
  let api1 = declare "api1" ["Description 1"] (i1 @-> s1 @-> returning b1 e1)
  let api2 = declare "api2" ["Description 2"] (s1 @-> returning i1 e1)

end

(* By passing in different modules to the `MyAPI` functor above, we can
   generate Client and Server modules *)

     and hence it is convenient to use the Monadic `bind` and `return`
     functions in Rresult.R *)
  let open Rresult.R in

  (* The server is used by associating the RPC declarations with their
     implementations. The return type is expected to be Result.result, hence
     the use of `ok` here. *)
  Server.api1 (fun i s ->
    Printf.printf "Received '%d' and '%s': returning '%b'\n" i s true;
    ok true);

  Server.api2 (fun s ->
    Printf.printf "Received '%s': returning '%d'\n%!" s 56;
    ok 56);

  (* The Server module has a 'server' function that can be used to service RPC
     requests by passing the funcs value created above. *)
  let rpc_fn : Rpc.call -> Rpc.response = server Server.implementation in

  (* To see a little more clearly what's going on, we will wrap this rpc
     function in something to print out the marshalled call and response. *)
  let rpc rpc =

  (* The Client module exposes client-side implementations of the methods,
     which expect to be given an RPC function with a similar type;

        client_rpc: Rpc.call -> Rpc.response

     This function is intended to take the Rpc.call value, marshal it to
     some wire format and send it to the server. Once the server sends back
     the response, the client_rpc function unmarshals that from the wire
     format, and returns a value of typ Rpc.response.

     As it happens, we can pass the server rpc function directly to the client
     module as a short-circuit of the above process.

(* The above was using the built-in convenience types. More complex types can

type vm = {

  name_description : string;
}

(* In order to be able to marshal/unmarshal values of type 'vm', we need to
   do a bit of work. First we create values representing the fields: *)
open Rpc.Types

(* The field is described as an (`a, `b) field - `a is the type of the field
   and `b is the type of the record to which it belongs. Name and description
   are obvious. The `version` field is described elsewhere, the `type` field
   needs to match the `b of the declaration. `fget` and `fset` are the lens
   functions. *)

}

(* The constructor function here takes a 'field getter' argument. This is
   a record with a single field, `g`, with signature:

       g: 'a. string -> 'a Types.typ -> ('a, Rresult.R.msg) Result.result

   this is used to obtain the values for each field. With this mechanism,
   the details of how each field value is obtained is up to the caller of the
   constuctor
*)

  getter.fget "name_label" (Basic String) >>= fun name_label ->

    "such as the name, description and other useful bits and pieces.";

(* Or we can create a variant type in a very similar way. As an example,
   we define a type `exnt` here: *)
type exnt = | Errors of string

(* And create values representing the tags first (only one for this type
   definition). Once again, `name`, `description`, `version` and `contents` are
   similar to those defined for the fields, and `preview` and `review` are
   the prism functions (similar to the lens functions for the fields above). *)

(* And then we can create the 'variant' type *)
let exnt_variant : exnt variant = Rpc.Types.{
    variants = [ BoxedTag errors ];

    vdefault = Some (Errors "unknown error tag!");

        | s -> Rresult.R.error_msg (Printf.sprintf "Unknown tag '%s'" s))
  }

(* And finally we name and describe the type in an `exnt variant def` type *)
let exnt = { name="exnt"; description=["A variant type"]; ty=Variant exnt_variant }
